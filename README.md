## Features
This interactive web application is a handy tool for users to search for the tour history and upcoming events of the artists they are interested in. The app has a side bar on the left and a map on the right. The app takes in the user input and maps out the past tour locations of the artist requested, the upcoming events, as well as the route between each of the upcoming event, with the closest date in different color. Each event is plotted as dot on map, and shows location and date when mouse hovers on the dot. A dismissable alert will pop up if no entry is returned from the user input. There is also a "clear search" button at the end of the sidebar to reset the search and start again.

Users can also search for upcoming events by city, and locate the venue on the map.

## Data and tools
#### Songkick API 
This project makes extensive uses of Songkick APIs, the APIs used are listed below
- Search: Artist search, Venue search, Location and metro area search
- Calendars: Artist's calendar, Metro area's calendar
- Gigography: Artistâ€™s gigography

#### Javascript Libraries and tools used 
- Bootstrap
- jQuery 
- Leaflet
- Underscore.js 

## Method
### Data Collection
#### Artist:
First, I used Artist-search API to get the ID of the musician or band input by user. Then I used the artist ID and the gigography API to get the past tour locations of the artist. Since the maximum return per page is 50 entries and most artists had toured more than 50 places in the past, I used function to get the total past concerts and total page I needed for the artists and stored them in a list to add markers to the map. Usually artists do not have more than 50 upcoming events so I did not used the function for upcoming event search.

#### City and venue:
Similar to artist search, search by city also requires the metor area's ID. So I first used the Location and metro area search API to get the city ID and then use metro area calendar API to get the upcoming events for the city. Venues do not require ID so I could mapped them directly on map with venue search API and user input.

#### Data Visualization 
This app uses JavaScript, Leaflet, CSS to visualize the past and upcoming concerts of musician and bands.
I used light green color for the markers for past tours and rosy red for upcoming tours. User can move the mouse to each marker to see the name of the location and the date the musician went to the location. For upcoming tours, I also generated lines between one location and the next one to visualize the route of the upcoming tour. The place where musician will be first in the future is colored in orange and used larger marker.
For city and venue search, the map will automatically zoom to the location requrested. I colored the upcoming events in the city that user search for in yellow and the venue in orange. User can click on the marker to see the artist and date of the upcoming events.
