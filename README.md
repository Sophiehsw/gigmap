## Features
This interactive web application is a handy tool for users to search for the tour history and upcoming events of the artists they are interested in. The app takes in the user input and maps out the past tour locations of the artist requested, the upcoming events, as well as the route between each of the upcoming event, with the closest date in different color. Each event is plotted as dot on map, and shows location and date when mouse hovers on the dot.

Users can also search for upcoming events by city, and locate the venue on the map.
